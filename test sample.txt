we can get learn from the movie that the father are badly sick,so he just urges to teach Hushpuppy how to be strong eough to survie by herself.
all those factors make the father love become more real and impressive.
second,the small group of people also show the close relatinaship among each other.
they all don't leave before the storm,and their joy.
and happy are natually express when they meet again after the storm.
given that,the warm atomosphere make me believe that they live together and depend 
on each other to survive in the poor environment.
